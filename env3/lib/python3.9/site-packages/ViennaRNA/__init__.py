    The ViennaRNA Package consists of a C code library and several stand-alone
    programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures.

    RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the most used
    function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic programming algorithms
    for structure prediction: the minimum free energy algorithm of Zuker & Stiegler 1981
    which yields a single optimal structure, the partition function algorithm of McCaskill 1990
    which calculates base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the suboptimal
    folding algorithm of Wuchty et.al 1999 which generates all suboptimal structures within
    a given energy range of the optimal energy. For secondary structure comparison, the package
    contains several measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
    tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, it provides an algorithm to design sequences
    with a predefined structure (inverse folding).

    The PyPI installer is maintained by Ayaan Hossain, so that Python developers can
    specify ViennaRNA as a requirement for their applications, without needing their
    users to download and install it separately. Because this is the 21st century, and
    dependency installation should not deter application adoption.
